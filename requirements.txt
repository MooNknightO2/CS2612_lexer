No Graphviz is required. The DFA visualizer uses Windows GDI+ via g++ (MinGW-w64).

Build requirements (Windows):
- MinGW-w64 toolchain with gcc/g++ (supporting -std=c++17)
- GDI+ headers/libs (shipped with Windows SDK/MinGW-w64)
- make (e.g., mingw32-make)

Build steps:
1) In project root run: make
   - Produces lexer_test.exe and dfa_visualizer.exe

Usage:
- DFA visualization: run dfa_visualizer.exe, input regex (type quit to exit); PNGs are saved as dfa_<n>.png.
- Lexer demo: run lexer_test.exe to see predefined test cases.
